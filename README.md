Things I think are neat... Idk I'll prolly js use this for random shi
Below there is a list of things I got in here.
# Formatting
I'll have each entry correspond to a section the README. This exludes the formatting (this) section and the first one.
Each new entry will be a new paragraph.
# First entry
Time to make compression algorithm
## Original thoughts
There are multiple types of compression and it depends on what and how I wanna compress it. I'll go for a *lossless* format generalized for all data. In turn, something along the lines of zip or tar. Making a custom file format sounds good for this. For now I'll focus on NOT making a kind of compression and simply fitting the data of a file structure into a single file, compression will follow from there.
I found a good name, CLOP. Why? Because it funny. HOLD ON research reveals this is a type of virus so let's not... .CLOSS because it's a mix of Compression Lossless O (becayse O) and SS for less because compreSSion make things leSS. Files all hold data, the extension just tells the machine what software to use. The challenge here will be to make that software. I'll make it a CLI interface because I am most familiar with that. Let's work on the basics now.
